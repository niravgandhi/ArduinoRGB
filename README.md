ArduinoRGB
==========

A basic Android application which communicates with the Arduino using serial communication.  

The Main activity converts the speech to Text through the Google API. 
If the text is found in the colorMap(HashMap), it sends bytes to the Arduino board to change the color of the RGB LED.
